This font doesn't seem to have a LICENSE attached...?

Rhythm Doctor's font is a modified version of 04b03! It adds several more glyphs to accomodate more languages.
However, this website currently only has the original version made by 04. We may recreate the proper font in the future.

You can find the original sources here:

Thanks for checking in!
